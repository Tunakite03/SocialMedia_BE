# Skill: Structured Development Workflow

## Five-Phase Development Cycle
Apply this workflow to every task, from small features to entire projects.

### Phase 1: Requirements & Clarification
**Goal**: Make requirements crystal clear before any work begins.

**Actions**:
1. Read and understand the request thoroughly
2. Ask clarifying questions:
   - What is the expected behavior?
   - What are the edge cases?
   - What are the acceptance criteria?
   - Are there performance/security constraints?
3. Document requirements in `docs/active_context.md`
4. Identify potential bottlenecks or risks upfront

**Output**: Clear, unambiguous requirements document

### Phase 2: Exhaustive Search & Optimal Plan
**Goal**: Explore all solution approaches and choose the best one.

**Actions**:
1. Search codebase for existing patterns to follow
2. Consider multiple approaches:
   - Simplest solution
   - Most maintainable solution
   - Highest performance solution
3. Evaluate trade-offs for each approach
4. Select optimal approach with clear reasoning
5. Break down into incremental steps

**Output**: Detailed implementation plan with justification

### Phase 3: Plan Validation
**Goal**: Validate the plan before high-risk or irreversible work.

**Actions**:
1. Present the plan when the task is ambiguous, high-risk, or changes public APIs, schemas, or infrastructure
2. Clearly state assumptions, trade-offs, and irreversible steps
3. Get explicit approval before destructive, schema-changing, or architecture-changing work
4. If the task is routine and low-risk, state the plan briefly and proceed with the smallest safe change

**Output**: Validated plan with the right level of approval

### Phase 4: Incremental Implementation
**Goal**: Build iteratively with continuous validation.

**Actions**:
1. Implement one functionality at a time
2. Test exhaustively after each increment:
   - Happy path
   - Edge cases
   - Error conditions
3. Update `active_context.md` with progress
4. Commit working increments (not broken code)
5. Move to next functionality only when current is solid

**Output**: Fully tested, working implementation

### Phase 5: Optimization & Suggestions
**Goal**: Improve and future-proof the solution.

**Actions**:
1. Review for optimization opportunities
2. Check security implications
3. Suggest additional features or improvements
4. Update documentation and memory files
5. Document lessons learned

**Output**: Polished solution + recommendations
