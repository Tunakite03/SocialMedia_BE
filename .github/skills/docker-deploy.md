# Skill: Docker & Deployment

## Dockerfile Best Practices
\`\`\`dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for minimal production image
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --ignore-scripts
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -u 1001 -G appgroup
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
USER appuser
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "dist/main.js"]

## Docker Rules
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size.
- Pin base image versions (e.g., `node:20.11-alpine`, not `node:latest`).
- Run as non-root user. Never run containers as root in production.
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude: `node_modules`, `.git`, `.env`, tests, docs.
- One process per container. Use Docker Compose for multi-service setups.
- Health checks: `HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1`.

## Docker Compose Template
\`\`\`yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
    env_file: .env
    depends_on:
      db: { condition: service_healthy }
    restart: unless-stopped
  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    volumes: ["pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data"]
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
      POSTGRES_USER: myapp
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD}
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U myapp"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 5
volumes:
  pgdata:
